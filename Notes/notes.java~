You want to store all info on Stuy students in a data structure
You want to optimize for...
1. Finding a student based on 4 digit ID
2. Adding a student by 4 digit ID
3. Changing a student (found by 4 digit ID)

You can use an Array with the ID numbers as the index
However, we would be using 10k slots for 3k students. This is not too much space
wasted. However, if we used OSIS number, we would have to make an array of 1
billion for 3k students
We can do even better by cutting down the array to a size of 4000. Just adjust
the IDs such that it fits into the array. Ex) 2792 - 1000 = index
